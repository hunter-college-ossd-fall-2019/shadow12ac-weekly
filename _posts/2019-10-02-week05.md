# How to Find a Good Project and My Experience with What I Learned So Far

### How to find a good project to contribute to?

On-line Reading: [Github's How To Contribute: Section 4](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to)

We are almost at the stage where we can finally pick a project and try to make some meaningful contributions. The above reading explains how to choose the right project to contribute to. It explains how open source projects are for the people by the people, meaning anyone whose willing can contribute and try to fix problems in the project. The article even provides the readers with link to various sites that help with discovering and contributing to new projects. Out of all the links that the article provided, my favorite is [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/). I think this site is very useful in finding a project worth committing to. You are able to sign up using your GitHub account and filter through repositories based on the prefered coding language you want. The list of repos are then organized from repos that have the most issues to the ones with the least amount of issues. I was able to find many projects that were in c++ that I thought were interesting for my first contribution. I feel like if explore this site further i will eventually find the perfect project that I can contribute to.
