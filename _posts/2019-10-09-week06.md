# Comments on Guest Speaker Karen Sandler and My Journey to Finding a Good Project

### Guest Speaker Karen Sandler

On October 3rd [Karen Sandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Sandler) visited our class as a guest speaker. She discussed her work and also her history with open source. The story she shared about the defibrillator that is implanted in her was very eye opening. Her story showed us how important open source is and how it can have an effect on someone's life. In addition, I learned alot about how licenses work and the rights people have on project they own and contributed to. I have a better understanding of the legal side of owning an open source projects and the code that people have contributed.
