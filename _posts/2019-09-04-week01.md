# Why I took this course?

I had two reasons to enroll in the Open Source Software Development Course for Fall 2019:

1. I was part of a small independent study class that focused on the same points and aspects as the course I'm currently taking. I learned alot through that independent study course and was eager to see if I can learn more from this class. It was fun working on projects and learning about the Open Source Community and I hope by taking this class I'll be able to continue what I started.

2. The second reason for taking this class was that I needed a 3 credit computer science elective that fit my schedule.
