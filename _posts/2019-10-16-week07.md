# Project Evaluation

Today's blog post is a shot and simple discussion on the two projects that I was able to look at this week. I will give my observation and opinions on them based on the assignment that was given to us in class.

### Gatsby

For our assignment this week we had to evaluate a project of our choosing. My group chose to look at a project called Gatsby. Gatsby is a web framework for fast websites. As a group we had to answer questions such as, "What is the project license?" or "Is the code easy to understand?". I thought this was a nice way to learn how to tell which projects are ideal to contribute to and which projects are not so welcoming. Gatsby seems like a great project to spend time to understand and contribute to. The community seemed very welcoming from their comments on issues and in their chat. The project itself is very active with lots of issues and pull requests being reviewed on a regular basis.
